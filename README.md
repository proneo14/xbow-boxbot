# X-Bow BoxBot
A _functional_ and _wirelessly controlled_ cardboard robot x-bow built for BoxBots 2025. 

**The idea** 

A ballista inspired by the X-Bow from Clash of Clans, translated to a fully operational and controllable system for shooting projectiles at your friends! Comes with an Atari-inspired controller to operate the x-bow, which wirelessly communicates with the x-bow via wifi. X-Bow movement is controlled by two stepper motors for the base yaw motion, and one stepper motor and rack-and-pinion mechanism for movement on the pitch axis.

**The design**
