# X-Bow BoxBot
A _functional_ and _wirelessly controlled_ cardboard robot x-bow built for BoxBots 2025. 

**the idea**
A ballista inspired by the X-Bow from Clash of Clans, translated to a fully operational and controllable system for shooting projectiles at your friends! Comes with an Atari-inspired controller using two ESP32s for communication between the controller and robot. X-Bow movement is controlled by two stepper motors for the base, and one stepper motor for the vertical movement alongside a rack-and-pinion mechanism.
